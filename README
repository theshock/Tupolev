Philosophy
==========
- All framework consists from only one file
- Methods which change classes inner state must return $this for jQuery-like chaning
- Framework must include all fundamental development tools, such as caching, templates, databases, forms, etc.
- OOP-implementation and architecture hides behind functional facade
- Stability is better than new features.
- All classes, methods and functions must be sufficiently documented, since API documentation generates from sourcecode.
- Convention is over configuration
- PHP 5.3 only
